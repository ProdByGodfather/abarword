# sample-abarword-django

A simple and specific example of a news website for `students` to practice and learn at an introductory level of Django.

The initial version of the abarword news website was released on `2/11/1400` with `asp.net mvc` and is known as an adopted child.
Now it is available to you as an optimized version in the form of Django framework in a simple and preliminary way.
